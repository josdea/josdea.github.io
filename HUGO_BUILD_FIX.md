# Hugo Build Fix - Summary

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow on the `hugo` branch creates blank HTML files when building the site.

## Root Cause
The workflow file is missing `submodules: true` in the checkout step, which prevents the Anatole theme (a git submodule) from being initialized. Without the theme, Hugo cannot build proper HTML files and outputs empty files.

Additionally, the current theme version (master/latest) uses Hugo's `try` function which was introduced in Hugo 0.127.0+, but the workflow may not be installing a compatible version.

## Solution
Three changes are needed on the `hugo` branch:

### 1. Update `.github/workflows/hugo.yml`
Add `submodules: true` to the checkout step and specify Hugo extended version:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
  with:
    submodules: true

- name: Setup Hugo
  uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v3
  with:
    hugo-version: '0.139.4'
    extended: true

- name: Setup Dart Sass
  run: |
    DART_SASS_VERSION="1.83.1"
    wget -q https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/download/${DART_SASS_VERSION}/dart-sass-${DART_SASS_VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz
    echo "0debcaf1e3de620d9d2aea205ce8a9a19e5a25641ee34578868536297646b33e  dart-sass-${DART_SASS_VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz" | sha256sum -c
    tar -xzf dart-sass-${DART_SASS_VERSION}-linux-x64.tar.gz
    sudo cp dart-sass/sass /usr/local/bin/sass
```

### 2. Update the theme version in `.gitmodules` (or manually in themes/anatole)
The theme should be pinned to v1.16.2 to avoid compatibility issues with the `try` function:

```bash
cd themes/anatole
git checkout v1.16.2
cd ../..
git add themes/anatole
```

### 3. Update `.gitignore` (optional)
Add `hugo_extended_*.tar.gz` to prevent accidentally committing Hugo binaries.

## Testing
After making these changes, the build should:
1. Initialize the theme submodule
2. Build non-empty HTML files (~12KB for index.html instead of 0 bytes)
3. Deploy successfully to gh-pages

## Commit on hugo branch
A commit has been prepared on the `hugo` branch with these changes:
- Commit hash: be96616
- Message: "Fix Hugo build: add submodules, update theme to v1.16.2, add Dart Sass"

However, this commit cannot be pushed from this environment. The user needs to:
1. Manually cherry-pick or apply these changes to the hugo branch
2. OR merge this fix branch into hugo
3. OR manually make the changes described above
