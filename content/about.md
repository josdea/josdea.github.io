As a data-focused professional with a diverse background in instructional design, LMS administration, web development, and technical solutions, I thrive on transforming complex challenges into streamlined, actionable insights. My expertise spans across instructional design using the ADDIE model, managing and optimizing Learning Management Systems (LMS), and developing web solutions with technologies like VueJS, JavaScript, and Python.

I specialize in creating and implementing data-driven solutions, from SQL reporting and VBA automation to designing interactive dashboards in Power BI. My experience includes training and supporting educators and staff, developing multilingual training resources, and enhancing system functionalities to meet evolving needs.

With a Master’s degree in Education - Curriculum and Instruction, I’m committed to continuous learning and growth. My goal is to use my skills in data analysis and technical problem-solving to improve efficiency, improve decision-making, and deliver results in every project.
