A simple [countdown timer](https://thejoshdean.com/timer) with a video background.

When the page loads it prompts the user for the minutes, seconds, and initial message. The message can be updated by clicking on it when the timer is going. Can be used for virtual meetings. I wanted a timer without ads and a clean interface.
